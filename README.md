# Aggregated Crop Data Viewer

This project provides a visualization of agricultural data using two independent tables. The first table displays maximum and minimum crop production by year, while the second table shows average yield and cultivation area by crop. Built using React, Mantine, and Vite, the application is styled for a clean and responsive user interface.
